  <h1> Day One:</h1>
  <p> She is still learning to use this, so it looks a little boring.</p>
  <p> It will get better. (: </h1>
  <h1> Day Two:</h1>
  <p> I have succesfully added an 'about me' page. Still working on it.</p>
  <p> Hoping to add kitten gif to the 'about me' page.</p>
  <p> An hour later, Kitten Gif Was added! <3 :) </p>
  <p> Twenty minutes after the kitten, I got greedy and added a dog gif to the home page. ▼・ᴥ・▼ </p>
  <h1> Day Three:</h1>
  <p> Okay. So it's a Saturday and I'm not even at school, but this was too much fun to leave alone.
  In the past twenty minutes of my life I added this paragraph, made the text under other headings smaller to be able to distinguish stuff
  , and managed to change the portfolio page's color three times until I settled on the minty green color. More updates to come later today.</p>
  <p>SO. It is now 10:23 pm (about an hour after the last update..) and I added an audio file. I struggled to stack it underneath the kitten gif.
  It took way too long, but I did it. All I had to do what place it under the source for the audio. I'm upset at the simplicity, but also glad that
  I was able to figure it out after some hefty trial and error. </p>
