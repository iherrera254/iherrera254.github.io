  <h1> Day One:</h1>
  <p> I am still learning to use this, so it looks a little boring.</p>
  <p> It will get better. (: </h1>
  <h1> Day Two:</h1>
  <p> I have succesfully added an 'about me' page. Still working on it.</p>
  <p> Hoping to add kitten gif to the 'about me' page.</p>
  <p> An hour later, Kitten Gif Was added! <3 :) </p>
  <p> Twenty minutes after the kitten, I got greedy and added a dog gif to the home page. ▼・ᴥ・▼ </p>
  <h1> Day Three:</h1>
  <p> Okay. So it's a Saturday and I'm not even at school, but this was too much fun to leave alone.
  In the past twenty minutes of my life I added this paragraph, made the text under other headings smaller to be able to distinguish stuff
  , and managed to change the portfolio page's color three times until I settled on the minty green color. More updates to come later today.</p>
  <p>SO. It is now 10:23 pm (about an hour after the last update..) and I added an audio file. I struggled to stack it underneath the kitten gif.
  It took way too long, but I did it. All I had to do what place it under the source for the audio. I'm upset at the simplicity, but also glad that
  I was able to figure it out after some hefty trial and error. Also, I changed the color of this page and I am now done for today because I'm sleepy</p>
<h1> Day Four: </h1>
<p> It is the last day we're being allowed to work on these in class before the websites have to be turned in.
I added some color and pictures of my 
own to the portfolio page and a royalty free soundtrack along with source information. I added some text to 
the home page and I described the page you're currently on
and the portfolio page. It's been fun and chances are that even though no one will
check in on this website ever, I'll keep adding to it until I no longer have access to Cloud9. For not having used any templates and only gone
onto W3Schools for RGB color values, I think this is pretty okay.</p>
